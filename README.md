# Aircon problem in the office

So we're having an issue. From time to time some peeps complain that it's "too cold" or 
it's "too hot". But it's really difficult to tell where's the issue. Is it the aircon 
setting? Is it clothes? Or is it something else?

To rule out the possibility of bad aircon or office management twiddling aircon knobs
I decided to gather some environmental data.
